This resource includes material presented at [XM2023][], the
international conference of the Brazilian Association for
Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, held in Curitiba Paran√°,
from 13 to 16 June 2023. Dr. Morgan presented a talk and two short
courses. The talk addressed the contribution and future of
*Bioconductor*.

- [A. How *Bioconductor* Advances Science][A]

Two short workshops illustrate use of *R* and *Bioconductor* in
genomic analysis, emphasizing modern single-cell approaches.  The first workshop
introduces *R*, then explores essential data
management tasks (for instance summarizing cell types and plotting a
'UMAP' in a single-cell RNASeq experiment) using the 'tidy'
paradigm. No previous experience with *R* is required.  The second workshop
walks through a single-cell RNAseq analysis using *R* and
*Bioconductor* packages. Users familiar with *R* will benefit most
from this workshop, but users at all levels should be able to follow
along.

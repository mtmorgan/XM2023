Description: This *R* package includes material presented at the
    international conference of the Brazilian Association for
    Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, held in Curitiba,
    Paran√°, from 13 to 16 June 2023
    <https://x-meeting.com/events/2023>. Dr. Morgan presented a talk
    on the contribution and future of Bioconductor, and two short
    courses illustrating how *R* can be used in the comprehension and
    communication of bioinformatic results, and how *Bioconductor*
    packages contribute to the analysis of current high-throughput
    single-cell and image-based genomic analysis.

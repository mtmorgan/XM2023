Bioinformatic researchers contribute to science through development of
innovative methods, and through application of established methods to
understand data they and their collaborators generate. *Bioconductor*
(https://bioconductor.org) plays an essential role, providing a
way for researchers to share their scientific contributions with a
wide audience while encouraging many 'best practices' in software
development, dissemination, and use. But science and technology change
quickly. This talk addresses how *R* / *Bioconductor* adapts to
challenges like single-cell and spatial genomics, multi-omics, using
*R* with other software languages, containerization, and cloud
computing initiatives.
